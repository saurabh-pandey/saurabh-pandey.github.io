title: "And I am back"
---
I had a gap of more than 2 years between my first and second post. This third one is just 1<span>&#189;</span> years later. I will see this as an improvement. Good thing is that I haven't given up on this yet.

I am also writing this while trying my luck with Jekyll. Just testing that the post I am adding is generated statically on my local environment. Thus this post also acts as a revision of my understanding of this blog tech stack. Amazingly, just adding this file as it is works, so all good.
