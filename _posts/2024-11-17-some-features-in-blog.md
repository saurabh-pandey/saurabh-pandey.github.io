title: "Some features in the blog post"
---
I am listing some features that I found useful in a blog post. This is a distillation after looking at many blog post on the web for all these years.
The feature list:
1. Tags: Categories that a post belongs to
2. Original Post date and last updated date: This is especially true for tech posts, as the time of the post is crucial to judge the actual usefulness of the post. Having last updated time is useful if I happen to update the post and upgrade the content for that time.
3. All tags in page: A grouping of all posts, tag-wise.
4. (Optional) Year-wise grouping of posts: This might become important if I happen to post a lot!

I will use above list to add these feature with time.
